//! `acpi` is a Rust library for interacting with the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, a
//! complex framework for power management and device discovery and configuration. ACPI is used on
//! modern x64, as well as some ARM and RISC-V platforms. An operating system needs to interact with
//! ACPI to correctly set up a platform's interrupt controllers, perform power management, and fully
//! support many other platform capabilities.
//!
//! This crate provides a limited API that can be used without an allocator, for example for use
//! from a bootloader. This API will allow you to search for the RSDP, enumerate over the available
//! tables, and interact with the tables using their raw structures. All other functionality is
//! behind an `alloc` feature (enabled by default) and requires an allocator.
//!
//! With an allocator, this crate also provides higher-level interfaces to the static tables, as
//! well as a dynamic interpreter for AML - the bytecode format encoded in the DSDT and SSDT
//! tables.
//!
//! ### Usage
//! To use the library, you will need to provide an implementation of the [`Handler`] trait,
//! which allows the library to make requests such as mapping a particular region of physical
//! memory into the virtual address space.
//!
//! Next, you'll need to get the physical address of either the RSDP, or the RSDT/XSDT. The method
//! for doing this depends on the platform you're running on and how you were booted. If you know
//! the system was booted via the BIOS, you can use [`rsdp::Rsdp::search_for_on_bios`]. UEFI provides a
//! separate mechanism for getting the address of the RSDP.
//!
//! You then need to construct an instance of [`AcpiTables`], which can be done in a few ways
//! depending on how much information you have:
//! * Use [`AcpiTables::from_rsdp`] if you have the physical address of the RSDP
//! * Use [`AcpiTables::from_rsdt`] if you have the physical address of the RSDT/XSDT
//!
//! Once you have an [`AcpiTables`], you can search for relevant tables, or use the higher-level
//! interfaces, such as [`PlatformInfo`], [`PciConfigRegions`], or [`HpetInfo`].
